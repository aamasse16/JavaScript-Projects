Pizza Menu

Made a website and added JavaScript to it and now you can add toppings and change sizes of the pizza and get 
different prices based on your own selection.

Tic Tac Toe Game

Play tic tac toe vs a computer than randomly selects a open spot on the grid and places an "O" sadly the
computer isnt very talented.

Calculator

Very basic calculator that can do basic math for you
